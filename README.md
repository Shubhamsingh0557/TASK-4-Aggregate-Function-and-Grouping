Summary:

    - COUNT helps us understand the distribution of publishers across countries.
    - AVG gives insight into the historical depth of publishing in each country.
    - GROUP BY organizes the data meaningfully by country.
    - HAVING filters for countries with a significant number of publishers.

Takeaway:

    Aggregate functions help quickly summarize and compare data across groups, so you can see which category is performing               best.
